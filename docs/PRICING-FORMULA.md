## Quotation Calculator

### Formula:

```
Total Project Cost = Labour + Infrastructure

Labour = Base Labour Cost × Complexity Multiplier
Infrastructure = Base Infrastructure (R 1,955.57) × Scale Factor

Where:
- Complexity Multiplier: 1.0 (simple) to 3.0 (complex)
- Scale Factor: 1.0 (small) to 2.5 (enterprise)
```

### Example Calculations:

**Simple Portfolio (like Tamaryn):**
- Labour: R 650 × 1.3 = R 845
- Infrastructure: R 1,955.57 × 1.0 = R 1,955.57
- **Total: R 2,800.57**

**Business Website (5 pages, contact form):**
- Labour: R 650 × 2.0 = R 1,300
- Infrastructure: R 1,955.57 × 1.2 = R 2,346.68
- **Total: R 3,646.68**

**E-commerce Site (10+ pages, payment integration):**
- Labour: R 650 × 4.0 = R 2,600
- Infrastructure: R 1,955.57 × 1.5 = R 2,933.36
- **Total: R 5,533.36**

## Infrastructure Breakdown Template

Use these percentages for ANY infrastructure cost:

```
Total Infrastructure = X

Web Hosting (48%) = X × 0.48
SSL & Security (22%) = X × 0.22
CDN (14%) = X × 0.14
Automated Backups (6%) = X × 0.06
Monitoring & Maintenance (10%) = X × 0.10
```
