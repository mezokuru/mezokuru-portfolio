# Logo Design Prompt for ChatGPT/DALL-E

## Primary Concept: MK with Spiral Transformation

**Prompt:**

```
Design a minimal, geometric logo for "Mezokuru" web development company.

Concept: The letters "M" and "K" where the K transforms into a spiral that encircles both letters.

Visual details:
- Letter M: Bold, geometric letterform in dark slate color (#2c3e50)
- Letter K: Starts as a normal K, but the diagonal lines smoothly curve and transform into a spiral
- Spiral: Golden/yellow color (#ffd166), flows organically from the K's diagonals and wraps around the MK
- The transformation should be seamless - the K's upper and lower diagonals naturally become spiral curves
- Style: Minimal, clean, geometric, flat design
- No gradients, no shadows, no 3D effects
- Vector style, white background
- Professional, modern aesthetic

The meaning: MK represents Mezokuru, and the spiral represents growth, awakening, and upward momentum. The K "unwinding" into a spiral symbolizes transformation and continuous improvement.

Color palette:
- Primary: #2c3e50 (dark slate blue)
- Accent: #ffd166 (golden yellow)
- Background: white

The logo should work at small sizes (favicon 16x16px) and scale up for larger uses.
```

## Alternative Simplified Version

**Prompt:**

```
Create a logo with letters "MK" where the K morphs into a spiral.

Details:
- M: solid, bold, dark slate (#2c3e50)
- K: vertical line is solid, but the two diagonal arms curve into a golden spiral (#ffd166)
- The spiral wraps around both letters
- Minimal, geometric, flat design
- White background, vector style
- The K should look like it's "unwinding" or "spiraling outward"

Style: Clean, professional, modern. Think: typography meets organic growth.
```

## If DALL-E Struggles, Try This Simpler Version

**Prompt:**

```
Minimalist logo design: Bold letter "M" next to letter "K" with a golden spiral element.

- M and K in dark slate color (#2c3e50)
- A simple golden spiral (#ffd166) positioned near the K
- Flat design, geometric, clean
- White background
- Vector style, no gradients

Keep it simple and geometric. The spiral should suggest growth and movement.
```

## For a Designer (Figma/Illustrator Instructions)

If AI fails, here's how to create it manually:

1. **Create the M:**
   - Use a bold sans-serif font (Arial Black, Helvetica Bold, or similar)
   - Color: #2c3e50
   - Make it geometric and clean

2. **Create the K:**
   - Start with a bold K in the same font
   - Color the vertical line: #2c3e50
   - Delete the diagonal lines

3. **Create the spiral from K's diagonals:**
   - Use the pen tool to draw curves that start where the K's diagonals would be
   - Make them curve outward and spiral around the MK
   - Color: #ffd166
   - Stroke width: slightly thinner than the letters
   - Add rounded caps to the lines

4. **Refine:**
   - Adjust curves to look natural
   - Ensure the spiral flows smoothly from the K
   - Test at small sizes (16x16px)
   - Export as SVG and PNG

## Inspiration References

Think of these styles (but don't copy):
- Stripe logo (minimal, geometric)
- Vercel logo (simple, bold)
- Linear logo (clean, modern)
- Figma logo (geometric, colorful)

But simpler and more minimal.

## Final Note

The key is the transformation: the K doesn't just sit next to the M - it actively transforms into a spiral that wraps around both letters. This represents the company's philosophy of continuous growth and transformation.

The spiral isn't just decoration - it's the K itself evolving.
