## Design Guidelines

**DO:**
- Keep it simple and scalable
- Ensure it works in monochrome

- Use clean, modern typography
- Maintain professional appearance

**DON'T:**
- Overcomplicate with too many elements
- Use gradients or complex effects
- Make it too playful or casual
- Use more than 2-3 colors
- Create something that won't scale down

- Social media profiles
- Email signatures
- Invoices and quotations
- Business cards
- GitHub profile
