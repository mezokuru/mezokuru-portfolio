## DALL-E Prompts

### Option 1: MK with Spiral Transformation (PRIMARY CONCEPT)
```
Create a minimal logo with the letters "M" and "K" where the K transforms into a spiral that encircles the MK.

Design details:
- Letter M: bold, geometric, dark slate color (#2c3e50)
- Letter K: starts as a normal K, but the diagonal lines curve and transform into a spiral
- The spiral: golden color (#ffd166), flows from the K and wraps around both letters
- The transformation should be smooth and organic - the K's diagonals naturally become spiral curves
- Minimal, clean, geometric aesthetic
- Flat design, no gradients, no shadows
- Vector style, white background
- Professional, modern, growth-oriented

The concept: MK (Mezokuru) with the K's energy spiraling outward, representing growth and awakening.
```

### Option 1B: MK Spiral (Simplified)
```
Logo design: Letters "MK" where the letter K morphs into a spiral.

- M: solid, bold, dark slate (#2c3e50)
- K: the vertical line is solid dark slate, but the two diagonal lines curve into a golden spiral (#ffd166)
- The spiral wraps around the MK letters
- Minimal, geometric, clean design
- Flat vector style, white background
- The K should look like it's "unwinding" into the spiral

Think: typography meets organic growth, sterile meets dynamic.
```

## Design Guidelines

**DO:**
- Keep it simple and scalable
- Ensure it works in monochrome
- Make it readable at small sizes (favicon)
- Use clean, modern typography
- Maintain professional appearance

**DON'T:**
- Overcomplicate with too many elements
- Use gradients or complex effects
- Make it too playful or casual
- Use more than 2-3 colors
- Create something that won't scale down

---

## Usage Contexts

The logo needs to work across:
- Website header
- Favicon (16x16px)
- Social media profiles
- Email signatures
- Invoices and quotations
- Business cards
- GitHub profile

---

## Alternative Text Descriptions

If you want to iterate, try these variations:

**Typography Style:**
- "monospace font" → technical, code-like
- "geometric sans-serif" → modern, clean
- "bold condensed font" → strong, impactful

**Symbol Ideas:**
- Upward arrow/spiral → growth
- Code brackets { } → development
- Interconnected nodes → web/network
- Ascending steps → progress
- Minimal mountain/peak → achievement

**Color Variations:**
- All dark slate with gold accent
- Gold primary with dark slate text
- Monochrome (black/white) version
- Inverted (for dark backgrounds)

---

## File Formats Needed

After generation, you'll want:
- PNG (transparent background) - for web
- SVG (vector) - for scaling
- ICO - for favicon
- Multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 256x256, 512x512

---

## Quick Iteration Prompts

If first results aren't quite right, add these modifiers:

**More minimal:** "extremely minimal, reduce elements by 50%"  
**More technical:** "add subtle code/terminal aesthetic"  
**More professional:** "corporate, enterprise-level design"  
**More modern:** "2025 design trends, contemporary"  
**Better spacing:** "increase letter spacing, more breathing room"

---

**Tip:** Generate 3-4 variations and test them at different sizes before finalizing.
